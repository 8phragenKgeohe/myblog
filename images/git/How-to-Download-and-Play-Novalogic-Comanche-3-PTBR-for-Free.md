Novalogic Comanche 3 - PT-BR is based on the BoeingâSikorsky RAH-66 Comanche, an American stealth armed reconnaissance and attack helicopter that was designed for the United States Army. The Comanche was a futuristic and advanced helicopter that incorporated stealth technologies, digital flight controls, and advanced sensors. It was intended to replace the Army's older scout and light attack helicopters, such as the OH-58 Kiowa and the OH-6 Cayuse.
 
The Comanche project started in the early 1980s, when the Army launched the Light Helicopter Experimental (LHX) program to formulate requirements for a new multi-role helicopter. In 1991, the BoeingâSikorsky team won the contract to develop and build the Comanche. The first prototype flew in 1996, and the second in 1999. The program entered its engineering and manufacturing development phase in 2000, with plans to produce 13 new Comanches for further testing and evaluation.
 
However, the Comanche program faced many challenges and delays, such as cost overruns, technical issues, changing requirements, and budget cuts. The program also faced criticism from various government agencies and experts, who questioned its viability, affordability, and relevance in the post-Cold War era. The Army decided to cancel the Comanche program in 2004, after spending nearly US$7 billion on it. The Army stated that it would redirect its funds to upgrade its existing helicopters and accelerate the development of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Only two Comanche prototypes were built and flown, and they are now displayed at the U.S. Army Aviation Museum at Fort Rucker, Alabama.
