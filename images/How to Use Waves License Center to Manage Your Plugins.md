Waves License Center works with both perpetual licenses and subscription licenses. You can activate your licenses to one device at a time, either your computer or a USB flash drive. You can also move your licenses between devices using Waves License Center.
 
To use Waves License Center, you need to download and install the Waves Central app, which is the hub for all your Waves products. You can download Waves Central from the Waves website[^1^]. Once you have installed Waves Central, you can launch Waves License Center from within the app.
 
Waves License Center has four main tabs: Licenses, Products, Updates and Settings. In the Licenses tab, you can see all your available and activated licenses, and perform actions such as activating, deactivating, recovering and moving them. In the Products tab, you can see all your installed and available products, and perform actions such as installing, uninstalling and repairing them. In the Updates tab, you can see if there are any updates available for your products, and install them if needed. In the Settings tab, you can manage your account information, preferences and notifications.
